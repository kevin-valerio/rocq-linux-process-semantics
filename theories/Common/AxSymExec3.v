(** * AxSymExec3 (Module AX2) — reflective certified symbolic executor.

    Image-INDEPENDENT.  A from-scratch extension of [SymExec] (whose
    design notes apply verbatim; read its header first).  What it adds:

    - VALUES: [EExt sx lo n e] (byte-slice extraction, so a narrow reload
      of a wider store, [lb]/[lh]/[lw] sign extension and [sb]/[sh]/[sw]
      round trips are modelled), [EBlob] (a byte range of an opaque byte
      string: file contents delivered by [read], a copied payload),
      constant folding for EVERY ALU/M op (computed with the ISA's own
      functions on closed bitvectors — sound by [Z_to_bv_bv_unsigned]),
      literal branch conditions decided without consuming the script.
    - ADDRESSES: [saddr] = arbitrary base expression + literal offset
      (not just a variable), so [p + n] style symbolic bases are legal;
      same-base questions are decided by [Z] arithmetic, cross-base
      questions emit obligations ([SCDisj]/[SCInside]) steered by a HINT
      script where undecidable.
    - MEMORY KNOWLEDGE: besides the in-block store log, the state carries
      facts about the BASE memory ([KWord], [KZero], [KBlob], [KImg]):
      spilled values / argv words, mmap'd zero pages, syscall-written byte
      strings, and untouched image ranges (.rodata/.data constants are
      then read straight out of the segment list).  A load is resolved
      log-first, then knowledge, then the [SCReadBase] fallback.
    - all integer loads/stores (lb lbu lh lhu lw lwu ld / sb sh sw sd),
      [fence] as a no-op.

    Soundness: [sym_exec_sound] — a [vm_compute]d run plus its side
    conditions give [CatSim.msteps] from any concrete state the entry
    symbolic state describes ([st_ok]).  Nothing is admitted. *)

(** ** RV64A atomics + reservation tracking; P-a/b/c

    STATE.  [sym_state] has a sixth (last) field [s_resv : option saddr],
    the symbolic LR/SC reservation; the record constructor is [SSR].
    [SS p r l k n] is a parametric ABBREVIATION for [SSR p r l k n None]
    (no live reservation), so a 5-field construction — plan
    checker, certificates, drivers — parses, computes and reduces
    without a reservation argument (and normal forms PRINT as [SS ...]).  [sset] /
    [sjump] preserve [s_resv]; [clr ss] clears it; [s_clean ss] tests it.
    Denotation ([AxSymExec3Sound.st_okR]): the machine is
    [SymStepR.mkstR regs pc mem rom (resv_denot E (s_resv ss))] where
    [resv_denot E (Some a) = Some (adenot E a)], [resv_denot E None = None];
    [mkstR regs pc mem rom None] is convertible with [PropExec.mkst regs pc mem rom].

    [sym_step] CASES for atomics (all with proof, [AxSymExec3Sound.sym_step_soundR]):
    - [Lr wd aq rl rd rs1] (any aq/rl): requires [amo_alignedb fk (rs1) wd]
      = the ISA's [amo_aligned] decided TRUE by [lin_lowbits_kn] on the
      address expression (low 2 resp. 3 bits provably 0), else [SStop].
      Address [a := to_saddrK fk (rs1) 0]; the read is resolved exactly like
      a [Load] of 4 bytes sign-extended ([.w], i.e. [lw]) / 8 bytes ([.d])
      through the shared [sym_read] (log, knowledge, [SCReadBase] fallback;
      same side conditions as a load); [rd := value]; [s_resv := Some a].
    - [Sc wd aq rl rd rs1 rs2]: requires alignment as above AND
      [s_resv = Some r] with [saddr_eqb r a] (syntactically the reserved
      address) — otherwise [SStop]: the FAILING sc is never produced.  Then
      behaves as a [Store] of the low 4 / 8 bytes of [rs2] at [a] (log entry
      [SE a 4|8 (rs2)], side conditions [flat_sc ++ storeok_sc]),
      [rd := ELit 0], [s_resv := None].
    - [Amo op wd aq rl rd rs1 rs2] for op in {SWAP, ADD, XOR, AND, OR}
      ([amo_aluop]; MIN/MAX/MINU/MAXU: [SStop]): alignment as above; old
      value [vold] by [sym_read] (4 bytes sign-extended / 8 bytes); log entry
      [SE a n (amo_newval fk wd aop vold (rs2))] where the new value is
      [rs2] (swap), [mkAluwK fk op vold rs2] ([.w]: 32-bit op, low 4 bytes
      stored) or [mkAluK fk op vold rs2] ([.d]); [rd := vold] (the value
      of rs2 is read BEFORE rd is written); side conditions
      [read scs ++ storeok_sc]; reservation: [resv_inval] (below).
    - [Store]: the usual log entry and side conditions; additionally the
      reservation is updated by [resv_inval (s_resv ss) a]: [None] stays
      [None] (the common case); [Some r]
      with [saddr_eqb r a] is killed; same base expression with offsets
      differing mod 2^64 is kept; anything else (undecidable aliasing) is
      [SStop].  ([Sem.inval_resv] kills a reservation on a store to EXACTLY
      the reserved address.)
    - every other instruction passes [s_resv] through.
    The [Load] case is phrased through [sym_read].

    DRIVERS.  [sym_exec], [sym_execS], [sym_execT] are wrappers around the
    tail-recursive loops [sym_exec_go], [sym_execS_go], [sym_execT_go] which
    carry a CHECKPOINT (the last state with [s_resv = None], with its side
    conditions / scripts): a run never hands back a state with a live
    reservation — if it comes to rest between an [lr] and its [sc] (stop pc,
    fuel, undecided branch, unsupported instruction) it returns the state AT
    the [lr] instead ([sym_exec_resv], [sym_execS_resv], [sym_execT_resv]).
    The entry state's [s_resv] is ignored ([clr]).  Consequently the
    soundness theorems [sym_exec_sound/_ex], [sym_execS_sound/_ex],
    [sym_execT_sound/_ex] are stated over [mkst], with
    the block-boundary [st_ok]; the general forms are
    [sym_exec_soundR], [sym_execS_soundR], [sym_execT_soundR].

    P-a: [decide_branch] falls back to [lin_branch]: [bltu] /
    [bgeu] decided by exact linear arithmetic ([lin_ge0]: [b-1-a >= 0] resp.
    [a-b >= 0]), [blt]/[bge] likewise when both operands are provably below
    2^63 ([erange]).
    P-b: [log_lookup], same base, read PARTIALLY overlapping a log entry:
    composed bytewise ([log_bytes_lit]) when every byte of the
    read is covered by a same-base log entry holding a LITERAL (newest
    wins per byte); result [lit_of_bytes]; otherwise stuck.
    P-c: [lowbits kn e j] (low [j] bits through AND/OR/XOR with a literal,
    ADD, SUB, literal multiple; leaves: literal, [ealign], [lin_lowbits_kn])
    is consulted by [mkAnd]'s [2^j-1] mask case before the other tests (on
    a case they also simplify it yields the same literal). *)

(** ** [mkSrl] split condition; align-down atoms in [erange]

    R4.1 [mkSrl]'s partial
       split [(A + R) >> s] (R3.3) fires ONLY when the residual R provably lies in
       one 2^s-block ([erange] of [unlin R]: lo >> s = hi >> s = q), giving the
       pure linear form [A/2^s + q] — the constant residual is folded by
       construction (e.g. [(4096 v + 6143 + len) >> 3 = 512 v + 770] for len
       in [17,22]).  Otherwise the whole shift stays ONE atom [SRL(A + R, s)],
       so relational [KRange] facts about the
       unsplit sum ([KRange (s + L)], shifted match) keep bounding
       it and no [A' + AND(SRL(R), -8)] address forms arise downstream.
    R4.2 [erange kn e] = the basic interval ([erange0]) tightened, when
       [e] contains align-down atoms [x AND -2^j] (j <= 48) under [ALU_ADD]
       nodes, by the interval of the de-ANDed sum ([deand], as
       [APC.deand]; re-normalised through [unlin (lin_of _)] so relational
       facts on the canonical sum match): [u e = u e' - rho], 0 <= rho <= s,
       hence [e] in [lo' - s, hi'] when [s <= lo'].  Pure tightening
       (intersection); [AxSymExec3Sound.deand_sound], [erange_sound]. *)

(** ** [KUnk], EXTENSION MODE, register cap, partial [mkSrl]

    All with proof ([AxSymExec3Sound]).
    The classic executor ([sym_step], [sym_exec], [sym_execS], [sym_execT])
    and its theorems do not use the items below, except
    (R3.3), which fires only where [mkSrl] would otherwise give up.

    R3.1 kentry [KUnk a n] (LAST constructor): the bytes [a, a+n) are
       DEFINED in the base overlay (mapped, readable and writable) but
       arbitrary; [n] may be symbolic.  Structurally a KZero: [prune_zf KUnk]
       / [kunk_cut] / [kbase]; lookups never hit it (no value).  Node-side
       lemmas: [AxSymExec3Sound.know_ok_unk_intro] (after any [wbytes]),
       [know_ok_unk_intro_pt], [kunk_of_zero|fill|blob], [kentry_ok_unk_grows]
       (preserved by every [mem_grows] memory change, e.g. any write anywhere:
       [kentry_ok_unk_frame]), [kunk_store_ok], [kunk_cut_sound].
    R3.2 EXTENSION MODE [sym_stepX K] / drivers [sym_execSX K], [sym_execTX t K]
       (section 4c): the classic step, then (a) the obligations the knowledge
       decides are DISCHARGED — this step's base read [SCReadBase a n sx
       (EVar (s_next ss))] when [a, a+n) is provably readable ([kn_readable]:
       inside one KUnk/KZero/KFill/KBlob/KWord entry by offsets or [xinside], or
       bytewise by literal-extent entries / image bytes), so the load yields a
       FRESH VARIABLE with no side condition; [SCFlat] likewise; [SCStoreOk]
       when the range is provably overlay-defined ([kn_overlay]) — and (b) the
       destination register is capped: with [K > 0], an expression of more
       than [K] nodes ([esize_le]) is renamed to [EVar (s_next ss)] ([cap_rd],
       [rd_of]); [K = 0]: no cap.  Soundness by ENVIRONMENT EXTENSION
       ([AxSymExec3Sound.st_okX], [sym_stepX_sound], [sym_execTX_sound] /
       [sym_execTX_ex] / [sym_execSX_sound], [AxSymRun3.runTX_sound]): from a
       state closed below its counter, some valuation agreeing with the given
       one below [s_next] simulates the run, and the result is again good for
       all valuations agreeing below the new counter.
    R3.3 [mkSrl]: when only SOME terms of the linear form
       have coefficients divisible by 2^s — A (divisible terms) + R (the rest
       and the constant) — and both the whole form and R provably do not wrap
       ([lin_nowrap], [lin_nowrap_l]): [(A + R) >> s = A/2^s + (R >> s)], the
       SRL atom covering only R ([lsplit_divc]); e.g. [(4096 v + 6143 + len)
       >> 3 = 512 v + ((len + 6143) >> 3)].
    R3.4 [erange] of [x >> s] atoms ([lo >> s, hi >> s]) and point-range
       folding ([foldK] via [mkAluK]). *)

(** ** Knowledge byte composition, prune keep-bytes,
    [KFill], EQ/NE by linear arithmetic, aligned/residual split of [mkAnd]

    All with proof ([AxSymExec3Sound]).

    1. [prune1]/[prune1p] (hence [carry]), KWord case (task 1): a store
       [k, k+w) that PARTIALLY overlaps a same-base [KWord (SA b kk) w' (ELit z)]
       keeps the untouched bytes as literal KWords — the piece below [k] and
       the piece from [k+w] up ([kword_cut]: widths [k-kk] / [kk+w'-k-w],
       values the byte slices of [z] folded by [mkExt]).  Non-literal values
       are dropped.
    2. [know_lookupA] (task 2): the walk is [know_lookupA0]; when it finds
       NO single covering entry ([LMiss]) but every byte of [rb+rk, +n) is
       covered by LITERAL knowledge of the same base spelling — a KWord
       holding an [ELit], a literal-length [KZero]/[KFill], or for the
       absolute base [ELit 0] an untouched image byte ([KImg] + [seg_rom]) —
       the read is the composed literal ([know_byte_lit]/[know_bytes_lit],
       [lit_of_bytes]; like P-b's [log_bytes_lit]).  Priority: log,
       single knowledge entry, THEN composition, then the [SCReadBase]
       fallback.  Also reaches [know_lookup].
    3. kentry [KFill a n c] (task 3; LAST constructor, so numbered case
       analyses elsewhere keep their order): base holds [n] copies of the byte
       [Z_to_bv 8 c] at [a], [n] possibly symbolic ([AxSymExec3Sound.kentry_ok]:
       flat + pointwise, exactly KZero's shape with byte c; no constraint on
       c, lookups use [c mod 256]).  Reads inside: [fill_lit sx n c] (hit
       decided exactly like KZero: [rel_lit] for a literal length, [xinside]
       / hint protocol otherwise).  [prune1]/[prune1p]/[prune1pc]/[kbase]:
       the KZero protocol, generic in the constructor ([prune_zf], [ktrim],
       [kcut]; [kzero_cut] = [kcut KZero], [kfill_cut c]).  [is_factb]: not a
       fact (memory entry).  AsanPlanCore.v / AxSymRun3.v: KFill treated as KZero in
       kentry_vars_lt, kentry_apart_b(p), havoc1(p) (cut by [kfill_cut]),
       grant_keep_b, live_vars, kn_gc_entry.  Node-side lemmas:
       [AxSymExec3Sound.know_ok_fill_intro] (after [wbytes M a (repeat (Z_to_bv 8 c) n)]),
       [know_ok_fill_intro_pt] (pointwise memory), [kentry_ok_frame_bytes]
       (entries apart from a written byte string survive), [kfill_cut_sound].
    4. [lin_branch] (task 4): [beq]/[bne] decided when one operand is
       provably strictly below the other by exact linear arithmetic
       ([lin_ge0] on b-1-a resp. a-1-b; needs both sides' no-wrap, i.e. base
       ranges).  Last resort of [decide_branch].
    5. [mkAnd] with an alignment mask (task 5).  [a AND -2^j] where the
       linear form of [a] has terms that are multiples of 2^j ([lsplit_div]:
       by coefficient or coefficient x atom alignment) AND residual terms:
       A + R with A = aligned terms + (c - c mod 2^j), R = [unlin (c mod 2^j,
       residual terms)]; if [erange R] lies inside one block [q 2^j, (q+1) 2^j)
       the result is the LINEAR form A + q 2^j, else A + (R AND -2^j) (the
       opaque atom covers only the residual) — [and_high_split].  Dually
       [a AND (2^j-1)] = R - q 2^j, else R AND (2^j-1) — [and_low_split].
       When nothing aligned can be split off (e.g. musl's [(n + 4095) & -4096])
       the answer is the R6 spelling 2^j (a >> j) resp. the plain atom.
       [erange (x AND -2^j)] = [lo - lo mod 2^j, hi - hi mod 2^j] from
       [erange x] (monotone).
    6. the align-up idiom [x + m - (x AND (m-1))]
       (compiler-rt [InitAligned]): [pageup_low]/[pageup_align] recognise the
       dual sign pattern c + y - (y AND mm) ([find_and_atom_k]/[pageup_low_k]
       with sg = -1, tried only after the sg = +1 musl page-up idiom failed), so
       [ealign] of SpaceBeg = 4096 v + 65536 - (4096 v AND 65535) is 16 and
       masks of it fold.  The normal form of the AND itself stays as is. *)
